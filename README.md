# CS 4641 - Machine Learning - Assignment 4
## Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning
Can Kabuloglu - Spring 17

### This project uses 2 libraries:
    - BURLAP
    - RL_sim

## Project Setup (BURLAP) (Uses Java)
1. Clone or download the assignment 4 repository (All the folders that found in the /BURLAP folder, that path should be used to import the project to Eclipse).
2. Download and install Eclipse IDE.
3. Import the project inside of Eclipse.
4. When the project is imported, right click on the top-level directory shown on the left.
5. Navigate through context menu to Maven, then click Update Project. This should resolve classpath issues.
Note: if you're having issues related to the classpath, or import/dependency issues try to repeat steps 4 and 5.
6. While inside the directory structure /BURLAP/src/burlap/assignment4/ right-click on the HardGridWorldLauncher.
7. Go to the “Run As…”n section and select “Java Application.
8. All three algorithms will run and the aggregate analysis and optimal policies will be printed to the console.

## Project Setup (RL_sim) (Uses Java)
1. Move to the folder /RL_sim folder in a terminal application and run the command java -jar rl_sim.jar
2. Chose the desired algorithm to run.
3. Load the mazes (soccer or small) and run the application by following the instructions on the page.
4. More information can be found in the help folder of RL_sim directory.


All the figures and the code to generate the graphs/plots can be found in the /figures directory.
